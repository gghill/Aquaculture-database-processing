# Aquaculture database processing
Organizing and processing global aquaculture data into models and visualizations

This repo is working to develop a pipeline from a database of aquaculture species to models describing the ecological niche of these species of interest.

[figures](https://github.com/gghill/Aquaculture-database-processing/tree/main/figures) include visualizations of modeled niches and other relevant graphical outputs.

[input data](https://github.com/gghill/Aquaculture-database-processing/tree/main/input%20data) is different versions and formats of the developing aquaculture species database

[output niches](https://github.com/gghill/Aquaculture-database-processing/tree/main/output%20niches) holds the niches generated by the scripts and should be the default destination for new time stamped script outputs.

[scripts](https://github.com/gghill/Aquaculture-database-processing/tree/main/scripts) is where completed and in process scripts for querying databases and developing niches are kept. Authorship of these scripts varies.
